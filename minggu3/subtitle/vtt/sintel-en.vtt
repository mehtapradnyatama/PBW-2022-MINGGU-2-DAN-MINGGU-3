00:00:03.608 --> 00:00:05.663
[Naui Yetnal Iyagi] : My Old Story

3
00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:27.541
The gloomy alley

4
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:31.249
Do you remember?

5
00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.524
I still remember

6
00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:42.261
Without words of love

7
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.905
Days gone by in waste

8
00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:51.332
Did you know about them?

9
00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.022
Our immature past

10
00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.711
Those beautiful nights

11
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:06.185
I still love them

12
00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:09.959
You naive one

13
00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:15.196
You're taking away

14
00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:18.622
my everything

15
00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:21.432
You cruel one

16
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.573
Maybe you were too shy to say

17
00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:30.254
Maybe you didn't like me

18
00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:35.257
I still have no idea

19
00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:41.325
If you're listening to this

20
00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:47.217
Please come find me darling

21
00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:50.078
I'm waiting

22
00:02:21.464 --> 00:02:24.174
You cruel one

23
00:02:25.068 --> 00:02:29.277
The night's taking away

24
00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:32.354
my everything

25
00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:35.743
You naive one

26
00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:40.405
Tonight, tomorrow night

27
00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:44.063
and all the nights to follow

28
00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:50.140
I wait forever
